# Why
This is intended to be an example of how to make a good-looking GUI in PowerShell.

# How
* The WPF is styled using [Material Design in XAML](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/).
* The data is taken from the public API http://www.namnapi.se/.

# What
The PowerShell script itself simply lists a number of randomized Swedish names in a window.

# Inspiration and links
There is great information about WPF out there, here are a few links to get you started in PowerShell.
